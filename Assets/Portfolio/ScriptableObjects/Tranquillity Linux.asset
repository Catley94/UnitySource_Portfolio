  description: 'This distro has been made purely from a learning point of view, where
    I can make my own arch based distro, custom software, install it easily, with
    different desktop environments and in the mean time learn how this is done. I
    will continue to update this iso and consider making a dedicated web page for
    it to explain it''s meaning. Made with Archiso - mkarchiso. '
