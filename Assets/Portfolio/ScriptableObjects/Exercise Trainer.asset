  description: 'The idea of creating this app was born from starting to run in my
    personal time, I needed an app which allowed me to do timed intervals of walking,
    running and sprinting. I found an incredible app on Google Play which allowed
    me to do this, however was hugely limited as I was only able to add a certain
    number of exercises per set before I had to pay for their subscription.


    I
    felt this was a complete ripoff, so used this opportunity to start creating my
    own App.


    With this app, you can create as many sets (which include as many
    exercises as you want within each set) as you like, you have the option of counting
    in either seconds or minutes (for the ease of saying 10 seconds vs 60 seconds)
    and when you start the countdown, gives a nice big timer with text to say how
    long you have left of this exercise, what exercise you are currently doing, what
    set you are currently on, and what is the total time left of all the set and
    exercises.


    Though this app was inteded for exercise, you could use this
    in multiple situations, as it is quite simply, an advanced timer application.


    Through
    personal use, I have found improvements that need to be made, such as adding
    a sound when the exercise changes (in this example, I was running and didn''t
    notice visually that the exercise had changed to walk, and vice versa, without
    keeping a hawk eye on the app at all times), therefore this app is still a work-in-progress
    however is at the point of being Version 1.


    I do have a standalone .apk
    which I have made within Android Studio (using the ionic API capacitor), so can
    pass this on through email or shared link, it is my hope in the near future I
    may publish this on Google Play so others can enjoy the benefit this app can
    bring. '
