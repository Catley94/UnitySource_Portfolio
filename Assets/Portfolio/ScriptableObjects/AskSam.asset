  description: "This is a private repo, in order to view the code, you must ask for
    permission by contacting me.\n \nAskSam is an SPA built with Vue (and Axios)
    on the Frontend and NodeJS on the backend. \n\nThe purpose is for anyone to submit
    a question on the front facing SPA (the user can submit as many questions as
    they like in one session or multiple), which will both create a cookie on the
    user's browser with the questionID (so it is able to keep track if the question
    has been answered) and submits the question to the database (MongoDB). \n\nThere
    is also another SPA for 'internal' or 'staff' use, on this SPA it will display
    all the unanswered questions in a list, the 'staff' member can click on any unanswered
    question (sorted from oldest at the top, newest at the bottom) and answer it,
    once answered it will update the database to mark this question as answered.
    When the user visits the website, it will check the database with the questionID
    in their cookie, if the question has been answered, it will update their page
    with the question as 'Answered', they then may click and view the answer given. "
