  description: 'Fireworks: This game has three fireworks that shoot up from the bottom
    of window.innerHeight, they are all affected by ''gravity'' with a constant pull
    to the floor, and are spawned with random speed values, so they all finish their
    path at different points on the screen. Once the firework has reached the end
    of its path, it will explode and create coloured particles (the colour is picked
    at random, at spawn of firework), with a random number between a min/max value,
    and there is a small chance that it will spawn a multicoloured firework. The
    spread of the particles once they are spawned is also random, giving the image
    of ''big'' and ''small'' fireworks.


    Puzzle: This game uses its own shape
    for the puzzle pieces using a custom path, depending on whether it is an edge
    piece or not, it will appropriately give a flat side to either one or two sides
    (depending if edge or corner piece). Once the grid has been made up, we overlay
    an image which is cut up accordingly to the puzzle piece. When the puzzle piece
    is interacted with (hovered over), the puzzle piece will move to it''s place
    on the grid, and the next available puzzle pieces will be spawned in (note that
    the puzzle pieces will only spawn in if they are the next available pieces),
    once the puzzle is complete, the puzzle fades out and the original image fades
    in.


    Football: Simple game made within Unity, making use of invisible borders
    (so the football cannot move outside of the pitch), a fixed camera of the pitch,
    the mouse controls a ''pointer'' in game which them interacts with the ball,
    affected by gravity as it has a rigidbody and a collider. Two goals either side
    of the pitch which both have collission triggers attached and triggers a sound
    and an image to appear when a goal has been made. UI Scoreboard updates when
    goals are made and sounds play when the ball is hit and when the player can start
    playing the game (starting whitle).

    And more!'
