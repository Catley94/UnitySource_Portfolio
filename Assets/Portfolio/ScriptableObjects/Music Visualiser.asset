  description: 'Inverted Wings use lines attached on a pulsing circle. Bass circles
    will omit once volume exceeds certain amount. Currently only has one song hooked
    up, however looking to improve this project in the future by connecting it to
    Spotify.


    This project was inspired by the old Windows Media player which
    has inbuilt Music Visualisers.'
